Artifacts accompanying the paper *Eadro: An End-to-End Troubleshooting Framework for Microservices on Multi-source Data* submitted for publication at ICSE 2023. This tool try to model the intra- and inter-dependencies between microservices for troubleshooting, enabling end-to-end anomaly detection and root cause localization.

## Data
Currently, we only upload codes and a small amount of our used data (about 10% in `data_demo`) because the data contianing metadata may reveal our identity. After double-anonymous reviewing, we will make all collected data publicly available.

The `json` file records the starting and ending time for an injected fault, while the child director contains three sources of data, i.e, logs, KPIs, and traces.

## UI
The final visualized page should be like:
